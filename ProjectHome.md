NATTT (NAT Traversal Through Tunneling) provides a simple tool that can (initially) be run on users' computers (servers, desktops, or laptops) that can tunnel through NAT boxes and provide end-to-end reachability. This goal is motivated by the observation that NATs effectively eliminate the ability of parties in the Internet to make arbitrary connections to any machine, as the target machine may lie behind a NAT box and thus doesn't have a routable address. Nevertheless, services that accept inbound connections (such as HTTP, SMTP, etc) may be run on these hosts and must be accessible from the public Internet.
