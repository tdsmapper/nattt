# Additional software/drivers #
  * The TUN/TAP driver should be installed on most modern Linux operating systems. In case it is not present, please find it [here](http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/index.html).
  * Please install the libpcap library. You need the one [from tcpdump](http://www.tcpdump.org), not the other libpcap.

# Details #

  * Installing NAT3D on Linux is like installing any other application from source (_./configure, make, make install_).
