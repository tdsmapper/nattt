#summary Windows development notes for NAT3D

= Introduction =

  * Windows uses the TUN/TAP driver from OpenVPN. Instructions to download and install are [WindowsInstallation here].
  * <font color="red"> Bridging abandoned. NAT3D uses routing instead </font>. The driver is used in the TAP mode mainly to support ethernet-TAP [http://openvpn.net/bridge.html bridging].
  * 

= Specific notes w.r.t Network behavior of the TAP device =
  * You must handle ARP for the network device. 
  * Replying to a query for an ARP request that asks for the address on the TUN/TAP device results in windows auto-configuring that device. See the source code for further details.
  * ARP queries for any network address in the TAP network should be replied with a different MAC address from that of the adapter (unlike Linux). See the source code for further details.
