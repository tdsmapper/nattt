#summary Windows development notes for NAT3D

= Introduction =

  * Windows uses the TUN/TAP driver from OpenVPN. Instructions to download and install are [WindowsInstallation here].
  * The driver is used in the TAP mode mainly to support ethernet-TAP [openvpn.net/bridge.html bridging].

= Specific notes w.r.t Network behavior of the TUN/TAP device =
  * You must handle ARP for the network device. 
  * Replying to a query for an ARP request that asks for the address on the TUN/TAP device results in windows auto-configuring that device.
  * ARP queries for any network address in the TUN/TAP network should be replied with a different MAC address from that of the adapter (unlike Linux).
