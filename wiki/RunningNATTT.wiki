#summary Running NAT3D

= Introduction =

You need to be an administrator to run NATT. However, in Linux/Mac, it is sufficient to have access to the TUN/TAP device.
Running NAT3D is with the following command on all Operating Systems:

_./nat3d <config file>_
(Read about the [ConfigFile config file]).



= Details =

  * NAT3D can be built with stderr debugging support enabled. To do this, please use the -DDEBUG flag in the Makefile (Mac/Linux/UNIX only).

= Bridging =

To make other machines behind the NAT box accessible to NAT3D, and effectively to external hosts, you may need to create a [Bridge software bridge] between the TAP device and your internet interface.
