# Additional Software/Drivers #

  * Installation of NAT3D on Mac OS X requires the [TUN/TAP driver](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/download.xhtml).
  * Installation of the TUN/TAP driver is similar to installing any other program on the Mac OS X
  * An error such as _unable to open /dev/tun0_ suggests the driver was not installed correctly.
  * PCAP library is required. You need the pcap lib. from tcpdump. not the other one. Find the portfile [here](http://libpcap.darwinports.com/). You may also find it in the SVN repository.
