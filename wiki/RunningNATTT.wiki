#summary Running NAT3D

= Introduction =

You need to be an administrator to run NATTT. However, in Linux/Mac, it is sufficient to have access to the TUN/TAP device.
Running NAT3D is with the following command on Linux/UNIX:

_./nat3d <config file>_
(Read about the [ConfigFile config file]).

On Windows:
_NAT3win.exe <config file>_

= Server/Client =

The same application can function as both the server and the client. You need to change the [ConfigFile config file] accordingly. When run as server, it is also required to forward the port from the NAT box to the port that NAT3D listens on (option in the config file).

= Details =

  * NAT3D can be built with stderr debugging support enabled. To do this, please use the -DDEBUG flag in the Makefile (Mac/Linux/UNIX only).



= Bridging  <font color="red">(deprecated) - no longer required</font> =

 <font color="red"> NAT3D now automates the process of sending packets/receiving to/from other hosts.</font>

To make other machines behind the NAT box accessible to NAT3D, and effectively to external hosts, you may need to create a [Bridge software bridge] between the TAP device and your internet interface.
