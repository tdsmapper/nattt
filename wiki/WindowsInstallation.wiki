#summary Installation of NAT3D on Windows
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

Installation on Windows requires 2 major steps:
  # Installation of TUN/TAP driver from OpenVPN
  # Disabling the firewall from blocking traffic on the TUN/TAP Device


= Installation of the TUN/TAP driver from OpenVPN =

As of now, the easiest way to get this done is by downloading the [http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html OpenVPN] Windows Installer (1 MB in size).

Once you have downloaded the OpenVPN Windows installer, open it, and install only the TAP-WIN32 driver from the "Choose Components" screen.

= Disabling the firewall on the TUN/TAP device =

One issue you may encounter with using NAT3D is that the Windows Firewall or a firewall from any other provider may not trust the network traffic on the TUN/TAP. This can lead to incorrect functioning of NAT3D.

Therefore, you might have to add the TUN/TAP device's network as a safe/accepted/trusted network. The default network used by the TUN/TAP device is 10.254.0.1/16
