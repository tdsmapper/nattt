#summary Errors faced with NATT

== List of errors faced with NATTT: ==

=== Unknown Ethertype FE0A ===
The problem is that NAT3 Daemon expects to open a TAP device, but opened
a TUN device instead. Add the following 
to the makefile CFLAGS: -DNAT3 TAP.

=== NXDOMAIN not returned by BIND9 on "A" Query ====
In several documents associated with the NATTTT Daemon, it is mentioned that the
application expects NXDOMAINs (Non-Existant Domains) to be returned by
BIND9 when the user application attempts to do a DNS query, at which point
the NAT3 Daemon takes over and re-issues the query with the custom DNS
Record type 1.

However, The NAT3 daemon checks for either a NXDOMAIN or for an empty answer section in the reply to the query.

=== BIND9 complains about unknown RR type with the custom RR type ===
This was an issue that came up with a version of BIND9 unexpectedly. The
solution followed at that time was to upgrade the version of BIND9 to the latest
version.
